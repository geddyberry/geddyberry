ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Oge Uzoma

ðŸš€ Data Analyst | Python â€¢ SQL â€¢ R â€¢ Tableau â€¢ Power BI | Remote-Ready | Data Storyteller

Passionate about turning data chaos into clarity. Whether it's cleaning thousands of records, building dashboards that deliver insights at a glance, or digging deep into trends that drive strategyâ€”I'm all about data that makes a difference.

ðŸ”­ Currently working on a series of mini-projects analyzing business performance, customer behavior, and market trends using Python and SQL.

ðŸŒ± Sharpening my expertise in advanced statistical modeling and data engineering best practices.

ðŸ‘¯ Excited to collaborate on open-source or freelance projects that need data cleaning, analysis, or dashboard development.

âš¡ Fun fact: I once cleaned 1mill+ rows of chaotic customer dataâ€”and loved every minute of it.
